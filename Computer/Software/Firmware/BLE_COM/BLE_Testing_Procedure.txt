BLE Testing Procedure
Step 1: Program Boards
├── Flash BLE Peripheral example to Board 1
└── Flash BLE Central example to Board 2
Step 2: Power On Sequence
├── Power on Board 1 first (peripheral)
├── Wait for "BLE advertising started" message
└── Then power on Board 2 (central)
Step 3: Observe Connection
├── Board 2: "Scanning started..."
├── Board 2: "Found device: qBLE peripheral"
├── Board 2: "*** TARGET DEVICE FOUND! ***"
├── Board 2: "Connecting to XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
├── Board 1: "BLE connection opened"
├── Board 2: "Connected to peripheral!"
└── Board 2: "Service discovery complete!"
Step 4: Observe Data Exchange
├── Board 2: "Toggled remote LED to: 1"
├── Board 1: "BLE WRITE RECEIVED" + "Value: 0x01"
├── Board 1: LED turns ON
├── (2 seconds later)
├── Board 2: "Toggled remote LED to: 0"
├── Board 1: "BLE WRITE RECEIVED" + "Value: 0x00"
└── Board 1: LED turns OFF
SUCCESS: Both LEDs should toggle in sync!
