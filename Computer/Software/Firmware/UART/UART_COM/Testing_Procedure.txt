Testing Procedure
Step 1: Setup Hardware
├── Connect Board 1 GPIO8 → Board 2 GPIO9
├── Connect Board 1 GPIO9 → Board 2 GPIO8
├── Connect GND to GND
└── Connect both boards to PC via USB (for power and debug)
Step 2: Program Boards
├── Flash "uart_sender" to Board 1
└── Flash "uart_receiver" to Board 2
Step 3: Open Serial Monitors
├── Open terminal for Board 1 (sender debug output)
└── Open terminal for Board 2 (receiver debug output)
Step 4: Observe
├── Board 1 should show "Sent: MSG:0", "Sent: MSG:1", etc.
├── Board 2 should show "RX[0]: MSG:0:HELLO_FROM_BOARD1"
├── Both boards should blink LEDs
└── If no messages received, check wiring
Expected Output (Board 2):
================================
=== BOARD 2: UART RECEIVER ===
UART initialized successfully
Receiver task started - waiting for data...
RX[0]: MSG:0:HELLO_FROM_BOARD1
Valid message #1 received!
RX[1]: MSG:1:HELLO_FROM_BOARD1
Valid message #2 received!
